            <h2>What is League of Legends?</h2>
                <p>League of Legends is one of the world’s most popular video games, developed by Riot Games. It features a team-
                based competitive game mode based on strategy and outplaying opponents.</p>
            <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>Players work with their team to break the enemy Nexus before the enemy team breaks theirs. League of Legends 
                is a complex game which involves both high-level strategy and fast-paced gameplay. Skilled players know how 
                to beat the opponent in front of them, while keeping the macro-elements in mind to support their team to 
                victory.</p>
            <h2>How It's Played</h2>
                <p>Each team assigns their players to different areas of Summoner’s Rift, the most commonly used map in League 
                of Legends, to face off against an opponent and attempt to gain control for their team. As the game progresses, players 
                complete a variety of tasks, including collecting computer-controlled minions, removing turrets (which protect each team’s 
                side of the map respectively), and eliminating champions (player-controlled characters). Players use the gold they earn 
                from these objectives to power up their champion and increase their teams control of the game. When a team is able to use 
                those advantages to move into the enemy team’s base and break the Nexus, they secure the victory.</p>
